# Complete-chess-game-in-python
Made a chess game with all the functionality of undoing moves and not allowing illegal moves including all the special moves in the game.


# requirements
Just need the pygame library to be installed, use below command to install if not already installed
```
pip install pygame
```

and run the file ChessGame.py

### this is a two player game as of right now, but I am working on making an AI to play against. Will update the repo when it's done and tested.
